# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-and-modeling
### In depth analysis of hotel data is executed in the project. 
### The data set consisted of two types of hotels: Resort Hotel and City Hotel. Further information of each was given like cancelations, arival year and month, number of days of stay, weekend stays, weekday stays, country, type of meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), type of guests(adults, children, babies), market segment etc.
### Using this dataset and information provided, various insights are derived. 
### Following questions are answered:
1. Where do guests come from
2. How does price of booking vary evey year
3. How much guests pay per night
4. Which months have more rush
5. Bookings by market Segment.
6. Number of Cancelation
7. Which month have maximum cancelations and how long do people stay
And many more analysis...

### Prediction Model
Cancelation Model is built to predict if the guests will actually come or not. This can help the hotel to plan things like food requirements and equipments.
Decision tree classifier, Random forest and Logistic Regression algorithms are performed and compared with Random Forest performing the best.
